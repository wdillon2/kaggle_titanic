# Project 1: Titanic

For our first project, we're going to take a look at the Titanic manifest. We'll be exploring this data to see what we can learn regarding the survival rates of different groups of people.



## Exploratory analysis
1. What was the survival rate overall?
2. Which gender fared the worst? What was their survival rate?
3. What was the survival rate for each `Pclass`?
4. Did any reverends survive? How many?
5. What is the survival rate for cabins marked **¯\\_(ツ)_/¯**
6. What is the survival rate for people whose `Age` is empty?
7. What is the survival rate for each port of embarkation?
8. What is the survival rate for children (under 12) in each `Pclass`?
9. Did the captain of the ship survive? Is he on the list?
10. Of all the people that died, who had the most expensive ticket? How much did it cost?
11. Does having family on the boat help or hurt your chances of survival?
